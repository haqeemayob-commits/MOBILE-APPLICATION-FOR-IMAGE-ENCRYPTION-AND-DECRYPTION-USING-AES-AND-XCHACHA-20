Mobile Application for Image Encryption and Decryption Using AES and XChaCha20
Project Overview

Mobile Application for Image Encryption and Decryption Using AES and XChaCha20 is an Android-based mobile application developed as a Final Year Project (FYP). This application is designed to protect sensitive images by applying strong symmetric encryption techniques before the images are stored on the mobile device.

The application implements AES-256 and XChaCha20 encryption algorithms to ensure data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. It is developed using Flutter and follows secure mobile application development practices aligned with the OWASP Mobile Top 10 guidelines.
